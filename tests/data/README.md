## What are these?

Those are binary serialized dumps of specific instances of collages that were sent to the core. We use these as testing data while working only on the core.

In the core look for the `TEST_COLLAGE_QUERIES` define to see how.

You can get more of these binary dumps from the somhunter logs folder. It's at `logs/collages/<timestamp>/Collage_instance_serialized.bin`.
